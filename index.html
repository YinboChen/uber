  <h1>CSCI 5849: Weekly Assignment 9 - AAC </h1>
  <h3> Group members: Yinbo Chen, Mutian Yan </h3>

  <h3> Description </h3>
  <p>
  Based on our brainstorming in Wednesday's class, We built an interactive UI sketch for our AAC project. Imagine in the scenario, the Uber driver is not capable of talking to the passenger, all the interactions rely on this screen/window display around the passenger seat.  </p>
  
  <p> When the driver arrives at the pickup location, the passenger's name is displayed on the side window so that passenger can know the uber is for him. </p>

  <p>There are a series of accommodations for the uber passenger to have a better experience: choose music genres, adjust tempeature, charge phones, want a water bottle, etc. </p>
